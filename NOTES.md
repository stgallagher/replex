Project - Workout Log

* Simple, fun in workout interface
* Storage of workout
* Easy timeline views

* Killer feature: intuitive interface that you can easily see and interact with during an intense workout
    * Gestures first approach
    * Web client preferably but might have to go with mobile. Will have to go with mobile eventually
* I want it to zoom in and out in an animated way from the context of a whole workout to an inter-set context. The workout context should animate to a timeline/calendar.
* Stats view as well
* Use to practice technologies
    * Engineering
        * Different backends
            * SQL - Postgress
            * NoSQL - Elastic search
            * GraphQL
        * UI Frameworks
            * React
            * Vue
        * APIs/Server
            * Go
            * Node
            * AWS
        * Deployment
            * Docker
        * Mobilemacv
            * Swift
    * Product design
        * Figma

MVP
* A fillable workout log
    * Can enter multiple logs
    * Each log can consist of
        * Date with optional time
        * Muscle group names
        * Exercise names
        * Sets
        * Reps and weights
* An index of workout dates that link to the logs
* Full stack implementation of the above


Technical Goals
* UI Framework (React)
    * Render MVP pages
* APIs
    * Interact with basic CRUD operations
    * (Optional) Integrate with AWS
* GraphQL
    * Interact with basic CRUD operations
* Database
    * SQL interactions with APIs to store, update, delete and fetch data
    * (Optional) Utilize a NoSQL database (Elasticsearch)
* Docker
    * Deploy the necessary stack
* Deployment
    * Secure and configure hosting options such that the application is available over the internet
